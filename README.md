-----Text Encryption and Decryption Tool-----

Overview
The Text Encryption and Decryption Tool is a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) project designed to provide users with a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt text using a secure algorithm. This tool ensures data security by requiring a user-provided password for validation before performing any encryption or decryption operations.

Features
Encryption: Allows users to encrypt input text using a secure encryption algorithm.
Decryption: Enables users to decrypt encrypted text back to its original form using the provided password.
Password Validation: Ensures security by requiring users to provide a password for validation before encryption or decryption.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive GUI for seamless interaction with the tool.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the backend logic.
Tkinter: GUI framework utilized for creating the graphical user interface.
Base64: Encoding technique employed to encode encrypted text into a human-readable format.

Usage
Input Text: Enter the text you want to encrypt or the encrypted text you want to decrypt.
Password: Provide a password for validation before proceeding with encryption or decryption.
Encryption: Click on the "ENCRYPT" button to encrypt the input text.
Decryption: Click on the "DECRYPT" button to decrypt encrypted text.
Reset: Click on the "RESET" button to clear the input text and password fields.
